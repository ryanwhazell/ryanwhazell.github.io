His identity is perhaps one of the best kept secrets in all of Waterdeep. Against all odds, the party found out the identity of this being when they discovered the vault of the guild. He is an ancient and powerful beholder by the name of "<em>Xanathar</em>." That title passes down when the leader perishes, such as when the party slayed him and took control of his organizaton for themselves.</p>

                        <p><strong>Known Affiliations: </strong>Seems to have some druidic-centric powers such as being able to teleport through plants. Posseses many powerful artifacts, such as a rod of hold person and an amulet of prismatic sphere, to name two that we've seen him use. He used to be a student of Grandmaster Soren, so he possesses some ability to shift between planes it seems. Little is known about his motives, beyond the apparent desire to force planes to merge into each other in a catastrophic manner. He has been called an "asshole" by nearly every party memeber, both in and out of game.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kai</strong> and <strong>Iruka</strong> hail from a hidden and forgotten land across the sea, seeking Waterdeep, or any haven to escape their violent and relentless Shinobi Clan from the Hidden Mist Village. </li>
                    <li><Strong>Dros</Strong>, Anti-Paladin of Gruumsh, seeks to spread the deeds of his god through conquest. Not looking for an easy win, he embarks to Waterdeep, one of the largest cities and well defended in all of Faerun.</li>
                    <li>Perhaps by will of her god or even through intentional means, <strong>Nari</strong> the Trickster Cleric of Tymora finds herself on the same boat as those above, and immediately begins causing mischief among the passengers. </li>
                    <li>On this boat, the party accomplishes a few things. They meet: Baldrick, a murderer fleeing from Neverwinter; The Langolyns, a noble elven couple with a disdain for orcs; a family of terrified refugees leaving their orc-razed village; Lan, Bran, &amp; Can, three farmers looking to pick up work at their family's farm outside Waterdeep; and a group of Merchants seeking to establish trade in the city of splendor. Many of the above died. </li>
                    <li>The gang got a sweet new house.</li>
                    <li>Also Can died in a pirate attack. Rest in peace, Can.</li>

                    <li>Becoming friends (which may be a strong word) on the boat, the party takes the key of the now-deceased Langolyn Nobles and makes their way to their new home in the Sea Ward.</li>
                    <li>Getting a foothold in the city, the party does some exploring. Dros gets a job as an apprentice blacksmith under Brian the Swordmaster, while Iruka joins the Fishing Guild.</li>
                    <li>The party wanders down into the Undermountain, perhaps ill prepared. Yet, they survive with riches to tell the tale. This story of success of some random adventurers circulates the Yawning Portal for some days, revitalizing the drive for would-be-adventurers to explore the ruins beneath the city.</li>
                    <li>Iruka yearns for the life of luxury. He expresses interest in registering as a Noble House of Waterdeep - a prestigious role indeed.</li>
                    <li>At some point they also explore the City of the Dead, Waterdeep's unofficial "7th Ward" and official graveyard. They find and kill a necromancer. They then find and kill his master. Some looting of corpses may have happened.</li>
                    <li>Sometime thereafter the party meets a half-giant named Jurdus, who has a love for frogs, gambling, tobacco, and bum fights.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The party is met by a neighbor who seems to know more than he lets on: Morgan Callisan of House Callisan.</li>
                    <li>In short, Morgan has a request: require his lost amulet which he believes to be in the vault of the Agents of the Eye, the most successful thieves guild in Waterdeep.</li>
                    <li>He gives the party a few things in return for embarking on this mission, including an (illegitimate but convincing) writ of nobility and some gold.</li>
                    <li>The party then sets out to find the agents hidden within the underground city of "Skullport" where they meet a job handler named Slackjaw</li>
                    <li>The party plans to gain the trust of the guild and find out where the leader hides his cash.</li>
                    <li>Thus far they completed a few missions: The assassination of politician and noble Nelos Oren, and the slaughter of the mercenary group know as the Knights of Waukeen, and </li>
                    <li>CRITICAL: Through their individual sleuthing, both Nari and Kai were able to discover that the Agent's Vault is hidden somewhere on the 3rd level of the Undermountain</li>

                    <li>As the season of Fall comes upon the Sword Coast, the party find themselves upon a city-wide open invitation to an event called "The Festival of Masks"</li>
                    <li>Following some petty theft of literature and turning a pompous man into a frog, the party found themselves being transformed into the creatures of the masks they wore.</li>
                    <li>Yaris the Celebrator, host of the party, explained the rules: last team alive wins.</li>
                    <li>So, the party killed their way to their reward: they may keep the masks and also get one free furnishing from Farengar's Furnishings!</li>

                <h2>Chapter 5 - Expedition Undermountain</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>With some new maps and armed with information of the Vault of the Agents of the Eye, the party sets back out to explore the Undermountain.</li>
                    <li>Shortly after finding the second level, they met a Dark Elf named Marrow. Marrow was looking for his escaped slave.</li>
                    <li>The party found the escaped slave, who was captured by a cult of Loviatar, the Goddess of Pain. The party made a careful exchange and acquired the slave without conflict.</li>
                    <li>Then, they found a bunch of cursed items and made the slave wear them. Until they items are removed, the slave is blind, deaf, and mute.</li>
                    <li>Not long after that, the party found and slayed some Gargoyles, then set up a camp in that room with some traps to protect them. This proved effective, and they awoke the next morning refreshed and ready to explore some more.</li>
                    <li>The party found a portal that lead to Acheron - a familiar location for Kai. They involved themselves in quite a mess between two zealous groups: Orcs of Gruumsh and Elves of Corellon.</li>
                    <li>The party was victorious, even if every elf and orc died besides the party. Dros elected to stay in this realm of eternal conflict to satiate his bloodlust for war and conquest.</li>
                    <li>The party returned to the Undermountain through the portal that remained open. Some more light exploration occured before Kai tripped a trap and was hit with a sleep dart. Iruka and friends carried him down the hallway which lead up to a secret entrance back to skullport. It was time to rest, for the battle was long.</li>

                <h2>Chapter 6 - Into the Fey</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>After resting up, the party gathers themselves only to hear from Slackjaw that things are getting chaotic on the streets of Waterdeep. Fairies, saytrs, trolls, hags, treants, and many other manner of fey creatures are pouring out of portals into the streets of Waterdeep.</li>
                    <li>Just then, there was a knock on the door: Ava and Eve, the Druid Sisters came to Waterdeep and sought out Nari and her party. All they knew is that something, or someone, was corrputing the Tree of Life - a massive Tree in the Feywild that grants life and power to many of those who worship nature.</li>
                    <li>The party, to be paid 50,000 gold each, agreed to help the Druid sisters, and set off.</li>
                    <li>There was a brief moment where they met a traveling alchol salesman, Torian, and his fairy helper. Klaus and some others made appearences as well. It was weird.</li>
                    <li>Eventually the druids led the party to a fairy circle in the woods north of Waterdeep. This circle served as a portal to the Feywild, to those who know how to use it.</li>
                    <li>The Feywild is a reflection of the material plane, so the party headed to where Waterdeep existed within the Fey. Even from miles away, they could see the Tree of Life extending hundreds of feet into the sky. Sadly, the tree looked corrupted, withered, and waterfalls of a black ooze poured over the tree tops and created rivers of ick in the streets of huts of fairy and fey homes.</li>
                    <li>The party entered the Tree of Life to find the source of the corruption. First, they were met with a maze of hostile assassin vines, patrolled by a deadly minotaur (not <em>too</em> deadly). Then, upon reaching the top of the tree, they were met with an unseemly crew of black robe and rotted hide wearing individuals - Astreus and his goons. Astreus trusted his people to dispatch the heroes, but he sorely underestimated them. A mistake he will not make again.</li>
                    <li>The party defeated the agents of chaos and destruction, and retrieved a mysterious crystal that powered the corruption of the Tree of Life. They took it back to the material plane, and handed it off to Grandmaster Soren - and expert of all matters extraplanar.</li>

                <h2>Chapter 7 - A Grave Mistake</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The next morning, Morgan Callister came to the party in a worried rush, as he'd just come onto some information that could mean his (and the party's) death if it were known: The location of the vault of the agent's of the eye. Hidden, on the third level of the undermountain, somewhere by an underground lake.</li>
                    <li>Afterwards the party went to visit Grandmaster Soren (shortly after meeting the Archmage: Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun</li>
                    <li>Tragically, the party arrived to a grizzly scene. The floor was decorated with the corpse of Soren, throat slit lying in a pool of growing blood. Sitting in his desk was one other than Astraeus, the culprit behind not only this murder, but also the corruption of the Feywild.</li>
                    <li>Astraeus chose to spare the party, with the silent agreement that they would not stand in his way, should the planes begin to collide again.</li>
                    <li>Beyond that, and some light shopping, the party descended down into the Undermountain once more, in pursuit of the vault of the Agents of the Eye</li>
                    <li>Also Iruka let Kai cut his head off in the Guillotine of Rebirth - he's a halfling sorcerer now. I guess if he doesn't like being a halfling, he can put his head through the chopper again. This new halfling's name? Tuddle, the illusionist sorcerer, and a long time resident of the Undermountain.</li>
                    <li>After these events, the party proceeded through the caverns of the third level of the Undermountain, also known as the "Sargauth" Level. I supposed they didn't know that the term "Sargauth" contains the word "Gauth", which is a form of Beholderkin. Regardless, the party came across a beautiful lake inside a cavern of crystals and bioluminescent mosses and rocks. The translucent lake rippled with every color of the rainbow whenever disturbed.</li>
                    <li>After a moment, an argument broke out between Kai and Tuddle, embodying the frustration Kai had of losing Iruka so quickly after losing Soren.</li>
                    <li>In that moment, it became somewhat evident that Kai and Tuddle fell to the mercy of the powerful psionic domination of an Aboleth lurking beneath the depths of the lake's surface. Kai's sharingan allowed him to slowly dispel the illusions of this Aboleth, revealing that deception of the beauty of the lake and this portion of the cavern.</li>
                    <li>It was a long and brutal fight, but the party managed to slay the Aboleth, and free the minds of Tuddle and Kai. The party swam to the bottom of the lake, emerging in a small rocky pocket of air with a large stainless steel door: The Vault Entrance.</li>
                    <li>This vault contained riches beyond the party's wildest desires. Mounds of gold and platinum pieces nearing the ceiling, gems of every color and cut, sceptars and rods and amulets encrusted with complex and perfec jewelry, crowns and statues and paintings of masterful make. Yet, there was something else in this room. A small portion of it was dedictated to the purpose of survaillence, with the use of many pools and mirrors of scrying. The party saw that whoever owned this vault had been watching many people in Waterdeep. Blackstaff Tower, various shops and political houses, Morgan Callister, even House Fork. They even caught a glimps of Durnan and Brian the Swordmaster donning masks of the hidden lords.</li>
                    <li>Just then, the portal in the room activated, and a terrible, elder beholder of a powerful lineage emerged: none other than Xanathar himself, the leader of the Agents of the Eye.</li>
                    <li>The beholder wasted no time neutralizing his opponents. Whether charmed, terrified, put to sleep or turned to stone, each member of the group was incapacitated in one form or another. One can only imagine what horrors lay in store when, and if, they awake.</li>

                <h2>Chapter 8 - Xanathar's Thieves Guild</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>When the party awoke, they found themselves bound, caged, or otherwise restrained. Xanatahr, a horrific, ancient beholder entered the room with Slackjaw, and his assistant, Viconia. After some light torturing and the loss of Jurdus's arm, Xanathar orders Viconia and Slackjaw to dispatch them and leaves the room.</li>
                    <li>Slackjaw's betrayal of the party was a farce, though. He turned his crossbow on Viconia, knocked her out cold with drow poison, and freed the party. Kai made the decision to finish off Viconia, and Tar Tar used his instant transmission to teleport the party to safety. Somewhat panicked, they quickly formualted a hasty plan. Tuddle cast a spell to fool the scrying mirrors of Xanathar, and Jurdus got a new arm from Brian the sword master.</li>
                    <li>Some party members thought attacking now was the best course of actions. Others felt it better to wait and strike at a later date. Slackjaw suggested fleeing and never coming back, and put his hand in for a group hurrah. Tar Tar took advantage of this moment to commit to the first suggestion. He teleported them directly to Xanathar's Vault.</li>
                    <li>The party did the impossible. By having an ace in the hole illusionist pulled from a magic gullotine only earlier that day, Xanathar was unable to anticipate being fooled. He also did not expect an immediate retaliation. The surprise attack was only so effective. Many party members were gravely injured, and Tar Tar momentarily perish. But the fight was won. Our five adventureres killed Xanathar, and overtook the Agents of the Eye.</li>
                    <li>Over the next week or so, things went relativel smoothly. The party settled into their new roles as leaders of the most powerful thieves guild in Waterdeep. Tar Tar learned a new technique from a grandmaster monk outside the city, then started up a fight club in the basement of House Fork. Kai put in a few jobs for the information gathering division, and Jurdus visited Brian the swordmaster to get a new arm. Tuddles decided he didn't like the socioeconomic structure of the world he woke up in, so they chopped his head off at the Guillotine again until Jeff rolled a character he liked: Cassius, the Wood Elf Rogue. They fought a Hydra, and go figure, Cassius died. Turns out rogues are not good frontliners when the opponent gets six attacks at 2d8 damage each.</li>
