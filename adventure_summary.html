                <h2>Chapter 1 - Don't Rock the Boat</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kai</strong> and <strong>Iruka</strong> hail from a hidden and forgotten land across the sea, seeking Waterdeep, or any haven to escape their violent and relentless Shinobi Clan from the Hidden Mist Village. </li>
                    <li><Strong>Dros</Strong>, Anti-Paladin of Gruumsh, seeks to spread the deeds of his god through conquest. Not looking for an easy win, he embarks to Waterdeep, one of the largest cities and well defended in all of Faerun.</li>
                    <li>Perhaps by will of her god or even through intentional means, <strong>Nari</strong> the Trickster Cleric of Tymora finds herself on the same boat as those above, and immediately begins causing mischief among the passengers. </li>
                    <li>On this boat, the party accomplishes a few things. They meet: Baldrick, a murderer fleeing from Neverwinter; The Langolyns, a noble elven couple with a disdain for orcs; a family of terrified refugees leaving their orc-razed village; Lan, Bran, &amp; Can, three farmers looking to pick up work at their family's farm outside Waterdeep; and a group of Merchants seeking to establish trade in the city of splendor. Many of the above died. </li>
                    <li>The gang got a sweet new house.</li>
                    <li>Also Can died in a pirate attack. Rest in peace, Can.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Becoming friends (which may be a strong word) on the boat, the party takes the key of the now-deceased Langolyn Nobles and makes their way to their new home in the Sea Ward.</li>
                    <li>Getting a foothold in the city, the party does some exploring. Dros gets a job as an apprentice blacksmith under Brian the Swordmaster, while Iruka joins the Fishing Guild.</li>
                    <li>The party wanders down into the Undermountain, perhaps ill prepared. Yet, they survive with riches to tell the tale. This story of success of some random adventurers circulates the Yawning Portal for some days, revitalizing the drive for would-be-adventurers to explore the ruins beneath the city.</li>
                    <li>Iruka yearns for the life of luxury. He expresses interest in registering as a Noble House of Waterdeep - a prestigious role indeed.</li>
                    <li>At some point they also explore the City of the Dead, Waterdeep's unofficial "7th Ward" and official graveyard. They find and kill a necromancer. They then find and kill his master. Some looting of corpses may have happened.</li>
                    <li>Sometime thereafter the party meets a half-giant named Jurdus, who has a love for frogs, gambling, tobacco, and bum fights.</li>

                    <li>The party is met by a neighbor who seems to know more than he lets on: Morgan Callisan of House Callisan.</li>
                    <li>In short, Morgan has a request: require his lost amulet which he believes to be in the vault of the Agents of the Eye, the most successful thieves guild in Waterdeep.</li>
                    <li>He gives the party a few things in return for embarking on this mission, including an (illegitimate but convincing) writ of nobility and some gold.</li>
                    <li>The party then sets out to find the agents hidden within the underground city of "Skullport" where they meet a job handler named Slackjaw</li>
                    <li>The party plans to gain the trust of the guild and find out where the leader hides his cash.</li>
                    <li>Thus far they completed a few missions: The assassination of politician and noble Nelos Oren, and the slaughter of the mercenary group know as the Knights of Waukeen, and </li>
                    <li>CRITICAL: Through their individual sleuthing, both Nari and Kai were able to discover that the Agent's Vault is hidden somewhere on the 3rd level of the Undermountain</li>

                    <li>Following some petty theft of literature and turning a pompous man into a frog, the party found themselves being transformed into the creatures of the masks they wore.</li>
                    <li>Yaris the Celebrator, host of the party, explained the rules: last team alive wins.</li>
                    <li>So, the party killed their way to their reward: they may keep the masks and also get one free furnishing from Farengar's Furnishings!</li>
